    <p class="about">
      Hi, you know my name; if you don't, I am <b>Surya Kiran Paluru</b>. I
      study at
      <b
        >SRMIST(Sri Ramaswamy Memorial Institute of Science and Technology)
        Kattankulathur, Chennai, Tamilnadu ,India </b
      >. I am currently doing my bachelors in
      <b>Computer Science Engineering</b> and of course with necessary
      <b>Mathematics</b>.
      <br />
      <br />
      I am a <b>Technophile</b>. I have a very keen interest in smart living. I
      am very intrigued by how we can enhance interaction between technology and
      humans by creating and constructing software that makes human life
      transparent. I am dexterous at my engineering core. I worked on my
      personal and open-source projects, which gave me exposure to real-time
      problems. I want to learn more in terms of advanced technologies and their
      impact on humans.
      <br />
      <br />
      I hope the above info is quite enough to know about me professionally.

      >
      out of some open-source datasets and love to test the accuracy.<b>
        I play cricket</b

      <b>I believe in building relationships with people.</b>
